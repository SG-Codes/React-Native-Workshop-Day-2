# React Native Workshop Day 2
In the second lecture of the week long workshop we created a profile card for the user.

## Profile Card
- User can add their picture to display.
- A profile link can also be attached in the card which will direct the user and open the link in the browser.
- Add linear gradient as well using react-native-linear-gradient npm package.
